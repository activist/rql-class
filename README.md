This is an implementation of Resource Query Language (RQL) that uses ES6 classes.  The implementation primarily focuses on the ability to apply an RQL query string against a JSON array.  

The original project (in AMD form) can be found at [github.com/kriszyp/rql](https://github.com/kriszyp/rql), along with some good documentation. It's some fine stuff, check it out. 
This [query engine sandbox](http://rql-engine.eu01.aws.af.cm/) is also useful for learning and testing with the original RQL engine.

See the [rql no-dojo repo](https://github.com/james-rae/rql-nodojo) for temporary documentation.
